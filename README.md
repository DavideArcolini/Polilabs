> **Polilabs** is a repository containing most of the solutions to the laboratories and exercise sessions I did at Politecnico di Torino, Italy



### `$ whoami`
Hi! üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
My name is **Davide Arcolini** and I am the author of all the reports and solutions you may find in this repository. From 2018 to 2023, during my academic years at **Politecnico di Torino**, I collected most of the stuff I did during laboratories and exercise session.
I use(d) this material both to **prepare my exams** and to recall concepts or snippets of code **during my daily activities**. For this reasons, the code is (typically) very **well-commented** and **well organized**. 

### `$ ls -l polilabs`
Well, I believe this repository to be organized in a user-friendly fashion. All the courses have their own identifier code plus their original name as-it-is, following the format: 
```sh
[01ABCDEF] Super Cool Course
```
You can find all the courses either in the `Bachelor` folder (which contains courses from my Bachelor's degree) or in the `Master` folder (which, surprise surprise, contains courses from my Master of Science degree).

### `$ more polilabs`
**Yes, sometimes I make mistakes!**

Please, consider three things: 
1. I am the **only author** of the material in this repository and not everything has faced or will ever face any kind of **peer review**. 
2. The repository spans a lifetime of **5 years** of work, from when I had 0-knowledge to where I am today. Back in the days, most of the laboratories were not done with the purpose of being published. For that reason, you may find something odd. Keep that in mind.
3. This repository contains **my personal solutions** to the exercises. These solutions **are not** the official solutions. 

If you are using this repository and you find: 
- errors, either in the codes or in the spellings;
- inconsistencies between what I wrote and what you found online;
- bugs of any nature;
- black holes;
- dark matter;

please, consider writing me at <davide.arcolini@studenti.polito.it>. I would **really appreciate** it. 

## Thanks!
