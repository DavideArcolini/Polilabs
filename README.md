### `$ whoami`
Hi! 🧙🏼‍♂️ 
\
My name is **<span style="color:lightblue">Davide Arcolini</span>** and I am the author of all the reports and solutions you may find in this repository. From 2018 to 2023, during my academic years at **<span style="color:lightblue">Politecnico di Torino</span>**, I collected most of the stuff I did during laboratories and exercise session.
I use(d) this material both to **<span style="color:lightgreen">prepare my exams</span>** and to recall concepts or snippets of code **<span style="color:lightgreen">during my daily activities</span>**. For this reasons, the code is (typically) very **<span style="color:lightblue">well-commented</span>** and **<span style="color:lightblue">well organized</span>**. 

### `$ ls -l polilabs`
Well, I believe this repository does not need a particular description since it is almost self-explanatory. All the courses are listed by their own original name as-it-is.

Here you can find most of the CS-related courses both from the **<span style="color:lightblue">Bachelor's Degree</span>** and from the **<span style="color:lightblue">Master of Science's Degree</span>**.


## 🧙🏼‍♂️ <span style="color:lightblue">Thanks!</span> 🧙🏼‍♂️
