A collection of codes and programs used to solve the laboratories in the System and Device Programming course in Politecnico di Torino during the academic year 2021/2022.

In particular: 
- `OS161 - OS internals` contains the laboratories regarding the *os161* operating system, the part of the course covered by professor **Gianpiero Cabodi**. In particular:
    - `LAB0x - xxx` contains the `walkthrough_LAB0x.md` file which explains, step by step, how to complete the lab.
    - `os161/` contains the actual implementation of the operating system. All the laboratory uses a specific configuration file called `LAB0x` where `x` is the number of the laboratory.
- `UNIX - Concurrent programming` contains the laboratories regarding the concurrent programming (a.k.a. thread and process synchronizations techniques) in the UNIX environment, the part of the course covered by professor **Stefano Quer**.
- `C++` contains the laboratories regarding the `C++` part of the course, covered by professor **Antonio Vetr√≤**.
