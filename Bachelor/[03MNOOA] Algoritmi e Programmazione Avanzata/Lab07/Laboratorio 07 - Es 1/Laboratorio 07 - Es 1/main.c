This leads us to the point in which we decide to reduce the amount of every jewels by the minimum amount of the set. So that, if we have a set like [10, 12, 11, 16] we can reduce it to a set like [0, 2, 1, 6], computing the necklace and add in the very begging of the neclace a string of jewels (retS, etsR, sreT or tsrE) according to the starting one in the necklace
