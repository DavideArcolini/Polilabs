Number of rules (primarily dangerous function names) in C/C++ ruleset: 222
Examining ../Introduction/CWE121/CWE121.c

FINAL RESULTS:

../Introduction/CWE121/CWE121.c:85:  [3] (random) srand:
  This function is not sufficiently random for security-related functions
  such as key and nonce creation (CWE-327). Use a more secure technique for
  acquiring random values.
../Introduction/CWE121/CWE121.c:27:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
../Introduction/CWE121/CWE121.c:42:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
