    Hash protocol.
    This script provides a non-secure hash protocol which uses a weak secret to hash
    a message.

*)



(* DECLARATIONS *)

(* types and variables declarations *)
free c: channel.                (* public channel used for communication *)
free s: bitstring [private].    (* the secret to be exchanged *)

(* functions *)
fun hash(bitstring): bitstring. (* notice that it has no destructor since it is a one-way function *)

(* assertions *)
weaksecret s.
query attacker(s).



(* MACROS *)
let sender() = 
    out(c, hash(s));
0.

let receiver() = 
    in(c, h: bitstring);
0.


(* PROCESS *)
process
    (
        !sender() |
        !receiver()
    )
