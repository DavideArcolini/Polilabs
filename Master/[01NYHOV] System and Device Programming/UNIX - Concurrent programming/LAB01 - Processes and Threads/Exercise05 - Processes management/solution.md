# EXERCISE 05
## Code implementation with processes

A binary number of size $n$ can be easily generated by a recursive function like the one reported in file `e05recursive.c`

Transform the recursive program into a concurrent one, replacing the
recursive procedure with the generation of an appropriate number of
**processes**.
Each process must display one binary number.
Binary numbers can be displayed in any order.

For example, if $n=3$, the function must generate and print numbers:
000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111
IN ANY ORDER.
